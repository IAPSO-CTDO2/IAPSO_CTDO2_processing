## ctdproc_steps.md

Compare the content (and ordering) of the processing steps applied to CTDO2 data

ctdproc_steps.md contains a list of data QC and processing steps, abstracted (as much as possible) to a form that can be compared across different groups and procedures. It may optionally contain steps for corrections and calibration as well. It may also contain notes on the order in which steps are applied if this is iterative or varies.
