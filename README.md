# IAPSO_CTDO2_processing

Getting started: 
- If you don't yet have your own (institution's/group's) branch, create one (probably from the default, go_ship_hydroman_2010)
- Modify ctdproc_steps.md, including the version/who uses it/source information at the top
- Optionally upload or add links to your code and/or documentation (and remove from documentation/ any files that are not relevant to your procedure)

## ctdproc_steps.md

Compare the content (and ordering) of the processing steps applied to CTDO2 data

ctdproc_steps.md contains a list of data QC and processing steps, abstracted (as much as possible) to a form that can be compared across different groups and procedures. It may optionally contain steps for corrections and calibration as well. It may also contain notes on the order in which steps are applied if this is iterative or varies. 

## documentation/

A place for documentation in your own format

## code/

A place for code to possibly be reviewed/tested (or put here for reference)
